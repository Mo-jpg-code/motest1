# Advanced Flappy Plane

This project contains a fully client-side arcade game inspired by Flappy Bird but reimagined with modern visuals and several gameplay twists.

## Features

- **Responsive HUD** with score, best score persistence (via `localStorage`), and power-up indicators.
- **Advanced plane physics** with smooth rotations, exhaust trails, and shield effects.
- **Dynamic obstacles** including moving gaps, tilting columns, and high-risk laser beams.
- **Power-ups** such as temporary shields, slow motion, and score multipliers that introduce strategic depth.
- **Parallax backgrounds** to create a sense of speed and depth, plus auto-pausing on tab switches.
- **Multiple control schemes** supporting keyboard, mouse, and touch.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in a modern browser (desktop or mobile). Click/tap the start button or press <kbd>Space</kbd> to begin. While flying:

- Tap/click/press <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Arrow Up</kbd> to flap.
- Press <kbd>P</kbd> to pause and <kbd>R</kbd> to resume.
- Collect power-ups to gain temporary advantages and aim for a new high score.

Enjoy piloting the advanced flappy plane!
